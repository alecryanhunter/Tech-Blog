# Tech Blog

## Description
This website is a rudimentary blog-style website. It allows users to create an account and log in to create posts and comment on other's posts. You have a dashboard where you can view all of your posts and make new ones. If not logged in, you can still view all the posts and comments, but just cannot add any of your own. If you view your own posts, you have the option to edit or delete them, which will properly update the database side.

This project was fun to do, but also somewhat stressful. It was nice to be able to highly refine something to a point where it's semi-recognizable as a website that people would use.

The website is deployed to Heroku [here]()!

## Future Development
This project is rife for opportunites for extra development. Allowing others to view posts by other users, effectively acting as a rudimentary profile, is a big one, as is being able to delete comments. Other options include: adding a following system so you only see blog posts by people you follow, allowing users to add tags to the posts for search purposes, and adding a user/post/tag search functionality.
